# GodBot — Custom Discord Bot

A fully custom Discord bot built in Python, developed specifically for my 
own Discord server. GodBot is the sixth iteration of a bot that started 
with basic functionality and grew into a full-featured community platform 
through continuous development and complete rebuilds.

## Background

Development started with a simple reputation system and expanded over 
multiple versions. Each version introduced new features or was rebuilt 
from scratch to improve the codebase and architecture.

- v3 — PixelBot 2.0: improved version
- v4 — LanPartyBot: community features

- v6 — GodBot: full rebuild with all features combined
